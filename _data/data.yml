career-profile:
    title: ABOUT ME
    summary: |
        I grew up in Ikaria and the last three years I’m living in Corfu where I study informatics. 
        Besides my studies I’m interested in sports and specifically in running and football which my experience with the university football team made me love. 
        Travelling and foreign languages are also some of the things that interests me. 
        In my third year I am planning to further improve my english communication skills and take the proficiency certification for the english language. 
        Two year ago I got my driving license. Further more, 
        I have participated in an Erasmus+ program in Cyprus, which gave me a more in-depth understanding of photography. 
        
        
        I love challenges and try to do my best with the time I have. 
        Also, I enjoy “running” in the stadiums or programs :).
